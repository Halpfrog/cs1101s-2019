// Question 3
/*
List of sounds are a list of pairs ending with a null

Take note:
The make_sound constructor ensures that all Sounds have the following property:

(get_wave(sound))(get_duration(sound) + t) === 0
for any number t â‰¥ 0, regardless what the original wave of the sound returns for t. The wave will simply return 0 when the duration is up. This Sound property will make your tasks a lot easier.

Piazza:
You can create piecewise defined functions like t => (t === 0)? 1 : 2

Your consecutively function returns a sound, which requires a wave and a duration. So the sound player will feed values of t between 0 to the duration into your wave function. Hence you have all the space within your wave function to figure out how to process the t value given, and return the correct amplitude.
